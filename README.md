Welcome to my Verilog Learning Journey! ðŸš€

This repository is a collection of Verilog codes sourced from various learning materials, accompanied by detailed comments for better understanding. My goal is to explore Verilog from diverse sources, learning different techniques and approaches along the way. Additionally, I'll be tackling various Verilog coding problems independently, providing solutions in dedicated folders. Join me as I delve into the world of Verilog, honing my skills and sharing my progress with the community!
